## Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achieving useful interoperability between C++ and Objective-C code is _hard_.  (See [the ‘Motivation’ section of this proposal](https://github.com/RandomDSdevel/RandomDSdevel-Evolution/blob/objcpprc/Proposals/P0001R0D0.md#motivation) for more details on this.)  Programmers may find C++–Objective-C interoperability desirable if, for example, they wish to write programs which make use of both C++ libraries like that language’s standard library and Objective-C libraries and frameworks like Cocoa.  In this initial draft proposal, I present some ideas on how to increase interoperability and feature parity between C++ and Objective-C programs above and beyond that which [the ‘Objective-C++’ language extensions for C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C#Objective-C.2B.2B) currently offer.
